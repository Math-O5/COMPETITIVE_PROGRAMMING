# COMPETITIVE_PROGRAMMING

  Here are some resolutions of competitive programming. I like to do this problems to improve my skills coding, distract from the dayly tasks. Note, this code is really messy up, since is done so fast.  

#  Languages used here and why:
## C++:
  - One of the most fast languages in TimeRunning.
  - The Standard Template Library (STL)
  
## Python
  - Big integers facilities
  - Easy manage of strings
