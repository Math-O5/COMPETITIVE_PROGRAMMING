<p>1. The sum of the angles inside a triangule if 180Â°</p>
<p>2. Every polygon can be split into (N-2) triangules. Then, the sum of their angles is (N-2)*180</p>
<p>3. Tales's Theorem: "the ratios of various line segments that are created if two intersecting lines are intercepted by a pair of parallels. It is equivalent to the theorem about ratios in similar triangles".<br>
If SB and SA are two segmentions with one point of intersection, and them are crossed by two lines paralles, which split SB into SAB and SCD, we can say that holds |SA|: |SB| = |SC| : |SD|
